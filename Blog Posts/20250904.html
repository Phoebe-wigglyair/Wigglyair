						<h2>Weening myself off of "content" - part 2</h2>
					<h4>Posted: 04/09/2025</h4>
					<p>Yesterday I crashed out because I wasted yet another day in the endless void of instagram reels and youtube video essays. I feel like I’m at war with my brain, she just doesn't want to let go of the quick dopamine, it's a fight I didn’t consciously realise was happening until recently and now I’m beginning to see how far behind I am.</p>
					<p>Drastic action had to be taken. Grey scale on my phone 24 hours of the day, 1 hour of distracting websites a day on my computer (Youtube, reddit, twitch, netflix, etc). Honestly now I am realising that 1 hour might still be too much, once that hour is up I am almost in pain having it taken away from me. I feel like that might be taken as hyperbole and I realise how pathetic it is, but it's the truth. I think I need to completely cut it out.</p>
					<p>Not only do I want my brain back but I want to start enjoying things again. I feel if I only interact with music, films and books I will feel significantly better than I was on my slop diet. Also data harvesting is no fucking joke. In making this website I wanted to implement a visitor counter. Just a small little counter in the corner showing how many people have viewed the website. In trying to figure that out I have found how absurdly easy it is to extract data out of website visitors. Privacy is absolutely fucking dead in 2025.</p>
					<p>You probably aren’t as bad as I am, your addiction probably isn’t as bad as mine is but do yourself a favour and prove it to yourself. Try and go a week without content, try and go a day. </p>
