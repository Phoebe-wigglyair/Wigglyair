						<h2>Weening myself off of "content"</h2>
					<h4>Posted: 23/08/2025</h4>
					<p>On New Years day 2025 I made a new years resolution to quit short form content. Absolutely no more mindless scrolling for Phoebe.</p>
					<p>Tragically I find myself eight months later scrolling more and more each day, wasting countless hours and withering away. Not only does it feel like I'm destroying my brain, I'm willingly being advertised to, consuming mindnumbing AI content, and frankly not even enjoying 1 second of it.</p>
					<p>After wasting yet another morning last week, I am really throwing everything I have to get myself off of Instagram once and for good. That's why I decided to make this silly website. I still wanted a way to connect, to reach out, and to put my mark onto the dying internet.</p>
					<p>AND FUCK ME, this has been so much fun!!</p>
					<p>I have learned a new skill, even just populating this place with stuff to see has been so rewarding. Archiving my past <a href="../Gigs/Gigs.html">gig posters</a> was suprisingly tricky and really showed me the value in keeping track of your history before it is lost. There were a few posters that were particularly hard to get a hold of (thank you Wayback Machine), even just a couple of years after they were performed. I'm so glad to have them all in chronological order all in one place. In the same way, tracking down all of my <a href="../Music Credits.html">Music Credits</a> was shockling hard, so often bands breakup, change names, don't release the track to begin with....</p>
					<p>All that's to say, do not exclusively leave your data and your history in the hands of social media. One day it might not be there anymore and it will be impossible to archive. Start now and save EVERYTHING that is important to you</p>
					<p>Hopefully maintaining this website will keep me occupied enough to stop the endless scroll, or at the very least lessen it.</p>
					<p>If you read all the way to the bottom of this blog I love you and here is a little <a href="https://www.addictinggames.com/sports/aggressive-alpine-skiing">treat</a></p>
