						<h2>Songe - Daughters Release</h2>
					<h4>Posted: 03/11/2025</h4>
					<p>So on the 1st of November we announced that we are releasing our debut album "Daughters" on the 28th of November.</p>
					<p>Everything I say in this blog is not "Offical" Songe release info or media, I just wanted to talk about this release and how it has affected me personally because this album means so much to me.</p>

						<p>Ëlle and I met in April of 2023 whilst being involed in putting on a hardcore show in One church Brighton. In a delirious haze at around 2 am after carrying about 100 chairs each down a tiny set of stairs I started playing the piano in the church</p>
						<p>I remember the moment Ëlle started singing, the acoustics of the room carrying her voice, I needed to write with her. I also remeber having goosebumps that night when she sat down at the piano and played a cover of "She Never Left" by CHVE.</p>

						<p>Fast Forward to Halloween of 2023 and we played our first show together supporting Hillary Woods. That was the first time we played "Songe", "Warmer, Hotter" live as well as a much more stylised cover of "She Never Left" by CHVE</p>
						<p>We have been writing what has become Daughters since then and I'm so immensely proud of how this album has turned out.</p>

						<p>In January of 2025 we recorded the entire album in 3 days at my home studio and I had them fully produced and mixed by around May. Since then we have been pitching the album to different labels to release with</p>
						<p>On the 17th of September we heard back that the wonderful Cruel Nature Records wanted to pick up the album, which I was beyond delighted about</p>

					<p>All of a sudden I went from being desperate for people to listen to this track to being completely overwhelmed by the speed that we needed to do things. Jcard designs, music videos, reviews, content. It was such whiplash</p>
					<p>Hopefully all the work will pay off and people will really enjoy what we have cooked up</p>
					<p>There are a few special thanks that I want to make for this release:</p>
					<p>Firstly my parents Matt and Laura. They supported Songe from day 1 and this album absolutely would not exsist without them</p>
					<p>Secondly Katie Tavini at Weird Jungle for mastering Daughets, I know I must have been pickier than most clients but she really did such a fantastic job getting everything sounding pristine</p>
					<p>Next shoutout is Jake Reid and his incredible photography skills for the album cover as well as all the other press shots, a serious talent and I'm chuffed I got to work with him on this.</p>
					<p>A huge shoutout to Lila Buckley for hand sewing and designing my dress for the album cover shoot. It came out so so wonderful and I am so grateful for her</p>
					<p>My wonderful friend Jessica Roch is featured on the last track playing her violin and it just ties the whole track together. Genuiely Wriath would not have been the same without her</p>
					<p>Finally I could not have done this without Ëlle. She is so uttely inspiring and joyful to write with, and the intencity of her performance is like no one else I have ever met. I am so unbelievably lucky to be in a band with her and she has worked so hard to make this release as phenominal as it is</p>
					<br>
					<p>If you want to pre-order the ablum it would mean the world to me. Light a candle, turn off the lights and get swept away</p>
